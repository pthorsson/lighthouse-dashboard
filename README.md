# Lighthouse Dashboard

An application for managing multiple websites in Lighthouse.

## Application info

The server of the application runs an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server
and uses web sockets to push the state of the audits to the client. It uses the
[Lighthouse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lighthouse) package to run the audits
from the server.

The client is build with [React](https://reactjs.org/).
